# About Me

Frontend developer expanding into full-stack development. I enjoy building practical applications and contributing to open-source projects when I can.

## Current Projects & Learning

**Full-Stack Development**  
Working on a web app that uses Google Gemini to analyze political news and provide summaries with credibility ratings. It's been a great way to learn backend API development while building something useful.

**Computer Science Foundations**  
Reading through "Computer Science Distilled" to strengthen my CS fundamentals. Since I don't have a formal CS background, I'm working to fill in knowledge gaps through self-study.

## Technical Skills

**Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, Sass
- JavaScript, TypeScript
- React, Next.js

**Tools**
- Git

## What I Want to Learn Next

- **Python** - interested in its versatility for backend work and data analysis
- **Rust** - curious about systems programming and its performance benefits

## Open Source

Always looking for opportunities to contribute to projects that match my interests in web development and developer tools.
